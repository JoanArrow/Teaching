#Teaching demo showing Grover search on n bits using Qiskit
#

def Grover(n):
#Define an interactive function that searches for a user-specified bit string 
#This string is represented by integer m in a space of bit strings represented by integer n
    
    import numpy as np
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, transpile
    from qiskit.providers.aer import QasmSimulator
    from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
    #bring in necessary packages for a Qiskit program

    # Use Aer's qasm_simulator 
    ### THIS MEANS THE PROGRAM IS NOT BEING RUN ON A REAL QUANTUM COMPUTER ###
    simulator = QasmSimulator()

    # Create a Quantum Circuit acting on the quantum 'q' register
    qr = QuantumRegister(n, 'q')
    cr = ClassicalRegister(n, 'c')
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)

#initialize input state as all 1s
### Note, most tutorials initialize in the all zero state, for Grover, the all 1 state saves on uneccessary gates ###
for i in range(0,n):
        circuit.x(i)


# Add a H gate on all qubits
### This produces the state |--...-> state, an equal superposition of all bit strings 
    for i in range(0,n):
            circuit.h(i)
            

### Ask the user to specify the bit string m to be marked for search ###            

#initialize the mark variable to enable the while loop to prompt the user for the bit string to search
mark = -1

#use while loop to prompt user for input and not move on until a valid input has been given
while mark <= 0 or n <= mark:
    #ask user for input
    mark = int(input("Which bit 0<=m<=n would you like to mark? "))
    if mark >= n:
        #throw error if marked bit is larger than the database size n
        print("Invalid entry, m can not be greater than n")
        
        mark = int(input("Which bit 0<=m<=n would you like to mark? "))
    if mark <= 0:
        #throw error if marked bit is negative (nonsensical)
        print("Invalid entry, m must be positive")
        #print(f"You have marked", mark)
        
        mark = int(input("Which bit 0<=m<=n would you like to mark? "))
    else:
        #once valid input is given, confirm marked bit
        print(f"You have marked", mark)
    
### Now that we have established the marked bit, implement the search (diffusion) operator
# Note Grover requires sqrt(n) calls to the search operator to maximize the probability of finding the marked state

#Search operator applied sqrt(n) times
for j in range(0, np.floor(np.sqrt(n))):

    for i in range(0,n-1):
            circuit.h(i)
                        
    Toffoli(n)

    for i in range(0,n-1):
            circuit.h(i)
            

# Map the quantum measurement to the classical bits
    circuit.measure(qr, cr)

# compile the circuit down to low-level QASM instructions
# supported by the backend (not needed for simple circuits)
    compiled_circuit = transpile(circuit, simulator)

# Execute the circuit on the qasm simulator
    job = simulator.run(compiled_circuit, shots=1)

# Grab results from the job
    result = job.result()


# Returns counts
    counts = result.get_counts(compiled_circuit)
    print(counts)
    
# Draw the circuit
#circuit.draw()
